# Speed Estimation Using YOLO

This project implements a vehicle speed estimation system using YOLO for object detection. The system processes video feeds to track vehicles and estimate their speed between defined points within the video frames.

## Features
- **Real-time Vehicle Detection**: Uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) for fast and accurate object detection.
- **Speed Calculation**: Estimates vehicle speed based on the distance traveled between two reference points in video frames.
- **Frame-by-Frame Analysis**: Processes video data to extract relevant movement and timing details.

## Example Results
Below are example outputs showcasing how the model performs during testing:
